# Webhook Debug - Real Phone Messages Not Appearing

## Current Status
- Webhook endpoint is working correctly
- Test messages process successfully
- Real phone messages are not being received

## Potential Issues

### 1. Meta Business Manager Configuration
The most likely issue is in the Meta Business Manager webhook settings:

**Check these settings:**
1. Go to Meta Business Manager > WhatsApp > Configuration
2. Webhook URL must be exactly: `https://04b918f8-1324-429a-8c64-ebdefef53c64-00-2atotxxaug2tv.worf.replit.dev/webhook/whatsapp`
3. Verify token must be: `whatsapp_labs_verify_2025`
4. Subscribed fields must include: `messages`
5. Webhook must be in "Connected" status

### 2. Phone Number Issues
- Ensure you're sending to: `+91 72197 98270`
- Try sending from a different phone number
- Check if the sender number is blocked or restricted

### 3. Meta App Review Status
- WhatsApp Business API might be in development mode
- Only test numbers can send messages in development mode
- Need to add your phone number as a test number in Meta Developer Console

### 4. Webhook Subscription Status
- Webhook might not be properly subscribed to the phone number
- Need to link the specific phone number to the webhook endpoint

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Meta Business Manager webhook status**
2. **Verify your phone number is added as a test number**
3. **Send test message and check server logs immediately**
4. **Confirm webhook subscription is active**
